# Synthesizing Retinal Fundus Photographies

This repository is structured in 4 important parts. 

    /
    - Retina Unet/          evaluation by a U-Net from [Retina Unet][https://github.com/orobix/retina-unet].
    - SynthRet/             scripts for generating synthesized images
    - SynthRetSet/          the generated images for training porpuses
    - ODregression/         find the wanted parameters for generating od
    - DRIVE/			DRIVE dataset
    - High-Resolution Fundus/ 	HRF dataset

## SynthRet

Images can be generated by running the following script:

    python SynthRet/generate_images.py <total number of images>

or if an offset is used:

    python SynthRet/generate_images.py <start index> <end index>

## Evaluation

To run the evaluation run the following:

    python RetinaUnet/prepare_datasets_SynthRet_Patches.py
    python RetinaUnet/run_training_SynthRet_Patches.py
    python RetinaUnet/run_testing_SynthRet_Patches.py

These scripts are adjusted scipts from [Retina Unet][https://github.com/orobix/retina-unet] to run all 3 wanted experiments.
